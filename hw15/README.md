Homework 15
==========================
Game Pitches
________________
Concept 1: "Central Park Snark!"

* One-player game in which the player is a bird flying low over Central Park.
  Turning only 4 times, the player racks up points for dispensing poo atop various objects in the park.
  These may be children playing, old men on benches, weddings, etc.
  A level ends when the player has flown off the screen, and a player continues to the next level only if they have pooped on enough people.
  The required number will increment each turn.

* This will be a 1942-style bombing game with 2-D graphics, and a lag between the spacebar bombing action and the splat.

* Technical hurdles:
  + animating the turning motion
  + randomly generating playable levels
  + stealing art from images.google.com

Concept 2: "Whitehouse Shootout: WE IN THE WHITEHOUSE NOW"

* One-player game in which the player must kill a fixed number of Whitehouse Staff members one by one.
  The first level would present Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, who doesn't fight you -- 
    he only talks about how hard the president works for you.
  Progressive levels would present more intense opponents like 
    Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Leon Panetta, Janet Napolitano, and finally Barack Obama.
  Barack Obama, however will not fight you.  If you reach Obama, you share a joint, and the text "WE IN THE WHITEHOUSE, NOW"
    flashes on screen.

* This will basically be a series of "Punch-the-Monkey" levels with progressive difficulty.

* Technical hurdles:
  +GRAPHICS -- Lots of images to make, though I don't think the characters would actually have moving body parts

Concept 3: "Peel the Potato"

* A potato, composed of some number of brown strips rotates as you peel off the skin to reveal white potato!
  Click down to touch the peeler to the tuber, slide to peel.  Once you finish a strip, the potato rotates.
  Randomly dispersed will be dark brown eyes, which must be clicked and removed before peeling is possible for each strip.

* This will play out kind of like a Warioware or Mario Party mini-game.  It will be AWESOME. Maybe.

* Technical hurdles:
  +Animating the potato will require the generation of lots of peelable brown rectangles that sit next to one another on a strip.
     Strips will have to be arranged on top of one another so that the middle (closest) is on top, and the rest successively are toward the bg.
  +Saving scores based on time will require an external high schores file.
  +Getting the peeler to follow the mouse and hang on an eye will likely not be tremendously difficult.
