1) My name is Sam Reeves.

2)  I have programmed in java and c++ (badly), and I ran debian for a few years... 
    I may have been what some call a "script-kiddie" in past years....

3)  I hope simply to regain use of that part of my brain which solves problems outside the gushy realm of "discourse."
